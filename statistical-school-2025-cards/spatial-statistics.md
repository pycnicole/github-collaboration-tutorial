# 空間統計 Spatial Statistics
What Is Spatial Statistics?
⚫ Data are observed or collected at spatial locations – Spatial data
⚫ Spatial statistics is concerned with analysis of spatial data in which the set of spatial locations are taken into

account

⚫ Data and/or locations are modeled as random, and inferences are made about these models or about

additional unobserved quantities

⚫ Spatial locations are used in a spatial analysis to model statistical dependence


Spatial correlation correlation, the farther away, the smaller, which affects the inference
forestry, astronomy, epidemiology, geology
How to smooth after merging data blocks
Time series regression calculates cor

regression mle estimates parameters

SAR: The smaller the AIC value, the more suitable the model (mle)
CAR:wij 0,1 matrix, diagonal is 0
Spatial structure of variables. Weight. Internal difference method.
